/*
Given two positive integers num1 and num2, the task is to find the sum of the two numbers on a 12 hour clock rather than a number line.

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers seperated by a space .


Output
Corresponding to each test case, print the sum in a new line.


Constraints:

1<=T<=100
0<=num1<=50
0<=num2<=50
 

Example:

Input:
