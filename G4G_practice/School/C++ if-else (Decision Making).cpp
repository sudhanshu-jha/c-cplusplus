/*
Given an integer N. Your task is to check if the integer is greater than, less than or equal to 5.
If the integer is greater than 5, then print "Greater than 5" (without quotes).
If the integer is less than 5, then print "Less than 5".
If the integer is equal to 5, then print "Equal to 5".

Input:
First line of input file contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follow. First line of each test case contains a single integer N. 

Output:
Print in a new line "Greater than 5" if the integer is greater than 5 or "Less than 5" if the integer is less than 5 otherwise print "Equal to 5" if the integer is equals to 5.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100

Example:
Input:
3

4
5

Output:
